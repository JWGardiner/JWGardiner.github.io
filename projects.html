		<p align="center"> This website is where I put my projects i'm working on, have my social medias, and sometimes post updates on upcoming features to projects etc. I made it to organise what i'm doing, and so people can see what i'm working on.

		<h2 class="subtitle" align="center"> The-Game-I-Am-Yet-To-Name </h2>
		<br />
		<p align="center"> This game is a WIP project that's very experimental and unfinished, and as such, I can't really give many details because I don't want to say i'll be adding stuff, and changing my mind which will let down people looking for those specific features! So, for now, you can get development updates on my <a href="https://twitter.com/JWGardiner">twitter</a>, where i'll post progress updates every now and then.
		<br /> <br />
		The premise of the game is progression; you start off with next to nothing, and try to build up to a modern world, but, you have limited resources and as such you need to find ways to suistain your current progress, for example, if you cut all of the trees down, you won't get any more wood, and it'll cause animals to die, giving you less food. The aim of this game is to make your actions have consequences, even if it's a seemingly tiny action.
